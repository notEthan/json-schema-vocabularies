    description:
      if the `set` keyword value is true, an array instance of the schema is considered to be a [Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)).

      this has the implication that the order of array elements is not significant, and that any duplicate elements may be removed.

      if the array can be represented as a data type which embodies a mathematical set, such as Python's [set or frozenset](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset) or Ruby's [Set](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/set/rdoc/Set.html), implementations should use such a data type for the instance.

      this keyword produces an annotation result whose value is the value of the keyword.

      this keyword produces no assertions.

      this keyword has no effect if the instance is not of type array.
    type: boolean
    default: false
